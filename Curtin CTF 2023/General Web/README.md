#General Web
## This challenge is continuity for Content Missing – II, but I don’t know why it’s name I. So anyway, we found the suspicious directory in the headphone photo named /homeChall. When we try to access the webpage, it just says the flag for this challenge.

## But when accessing using curl, there are hidden directory in the response.

## So, we try to access the hidden directory and get the flag.

## Flag: CURTIN_CTF{C0NGR4TUL4T10N5_0N_Y0UR_H0M3C0M1NG}
